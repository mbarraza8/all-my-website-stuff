<h1 style="color: rgb(71, 25, 114);"> My Break</h1>
<h2 style="color: rgb(119, 69, 165);">Christmas</h2>
<p style="font-family: sans-serif" During the first week of break, all I could think about was Christmas. The snow piling up and caroling coming from the speakers in stores made the atmosphere so festive. Before Christmas Eve, I stayed home for the most part but I did watch the new <em>Avatar Fire and Ash</em> movie which was awesome! I hanged out with my sister who came from college for the holidays and baked desserts. On Christmas Eve, all my family gathered together at my aunts house and we enjoyed a warm feast with lots of staple traditional foods like tamales and champurado.</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(119, 69, 165);"> New Years</h2>
<p style="font-family: sans-serif" During the second week of break I definetly got out of the house more. I went to visit my cousins, celebrated New Years Eves at my aunts house till 5 am, went to <strong>downtown with my friends to go vintage shopping</strong>, and made cinnamonrolls. This week definetly passed by faster than the first but was filled with lots of joy and adventure. I was upset about break coming to an end but was excited to see my friends at school.</p>
